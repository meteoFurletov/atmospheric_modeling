# Atmospheric Modeling Project Overview
This project is centered on atmospheric modeling, with a particular focus on the analysis of pressure, temperature, and wind behaviors across different seasons. The project employs the NRLMSISE-00 model, which is widely used for simulating the Earth's atmosphere. The analysis is designed to provide insights into atmospheric variations and their impacts on weather patterns in various seasonal contexts.
